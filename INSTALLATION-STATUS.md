# Docker Installation Status

## Current Status: Docker Desktop is downloading via winget

The installation is in progress. The Docker Desktop installer (570 MB) is being downloaded.

## What's Happening:
1. ‚úÖ Windows Package Manager (winget) detected
2. üîÑ Docker Desktop downloading (this may take 5-15 minutes depending on your internet speed)
3. ‚è≥ Automatic installation will follow

## If Installation Completes Successfully:
Once the download and installation finish, you'll need to:

1. **Restart your computer** (if prompted)
2. **Launch Docker Desktop** from Start menu
3. **Wait for Docker to start** (whale icon in system tray)
4. **Run our setup script**:
   ```powershell
   .\docker-setup.bat
   ```

## If Installation Fails or Gets Cancelled:

### Option 1: Manual Download
1. Go to: https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe
2. Download the installer directly
3. Run the installer manually

### Option 2: Try winget again
```powershell
winget install Docker.DockerDesktop --force
```

### Option 3: Use Chocolatey (if you have it)
```powershell
choco install docker-desktop
```

### Option 4: Alternative - Use Node.js Container Only
If Docker Desktop installation continues to have issues, you can use just a Node.js container:

```powershell
# After Docker CLI is available
docker pull node:22-alpine
docker run -it --rm -v "${PWD}:/app" -w /app -p 3000:3000 -p 5000:5000 node:22-alpine sh

# Inside the container:
npm install
npm run install-all
npm run dev
```

## System Requirements Check
Make sure your system meets these requirements:
- Windows 10/11 64-bit
- 4GB+ RAM
- Virtualization enabled in BIOS
- WSL 2 or Hyper-V available

## Need Help?
If you encounter issues:
1. Check Windows Features (Windows key + R, type "appwiz.cpl")
2. Enable "Windows Subsystem for Linux" and "Virtual Machine Platform"
3. Restart and try again
